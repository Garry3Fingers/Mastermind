# Mastermind
I need to build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code. The game must have two modes. The first is when the player guesses the computer code. The second is when the player makes  a code.

I need an array of six colors. Then the codemaker(PC) will randomly change the indexes of the elements in the array and slice four colors, starting from the very beginning. After that, the codebreaker(Player) will enter four-color guess(array?). The code must compare two arrays and give feedback. This will be in a 12 cycle loop.

When the computer becomes the codebreaker. I need to think about how to make an algorithm so that it can make a choice.
